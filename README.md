# Algo-Checkpoint

This repository contains an algorithm that performs various operations on a given sentence.

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm takes a sentence as input and performs the following operations:

1. Counts the number of words in the sentence.
2. Counts the total number of characters in the sentence.
3. Counts the number of vowels in the sentence.

The algorithm uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the sentence. If the character is a space, it increments the word count. If the character is not an empty string, it increments the character count. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), it increments the vowel count.

## Variables

- sentence: A string that represents the sentence to be analyzed.
- sentence_length: An integer that stores the total number of characters in the sentence.
- vowels: An integer that stores the total number of vowels in the sentence.
- word_length: An integer that stores the total number of words in the sentence.
- vowels: A string that contains all the vowel characters.

## Usage

To use this algorithm, you need to provide a sentence as input. The algorithm will then calculate and return the number of words, total characters, and vowels in the sentence.
